a list of small Project with C, so i can learn how to build things from scratch! 



## Project 1:
- Game Simulation Case Study: Rock, Paper, Scissors
### Description: 
Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The shapes are “rock”, “paper”, and “scissors”. A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win, or a loss. “rock” breaks (wins) “scissors”, “scissors” cuts (wins) “paper”, and “paper” covers (wins) “rock”. If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie.

#### Example: 
```==================
Round 0
==================
Enter 0 (ROCK), or 1 (PAPER), or 2 (SCISSORS): 0
Computer played SCISSORS
player WON!
==================
Round 1

==================
Round 2
