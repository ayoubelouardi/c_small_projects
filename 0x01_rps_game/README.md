## Project 1: RPS Game Simulation!
- Game Simulation Case Study: Rock, Paper, Scissors
### Description: 
Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The shapes are “rock”, “paper”, and “scissors”. A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win, or a loss. “rock” breaks (wins) “scissors”, “scissors” cuts (wins) “paper”, and “paper” covers (wins) “rock”. If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie.

the game will start with asking you for to choice then the computer will choose a random number, the winner is the one
ho winnes 3 games first.

#### Example:
